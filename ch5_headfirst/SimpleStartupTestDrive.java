// This code implements a simplified guessing game where the player guesses the location of a "startup." The SimpleStartup class tracks the startup's location and checks if a player's guess is a "hit," "miss," or "kill." The SimpleStartupTestDrive class serves as a test driver to validate the functionality with a predefined scenario
