// The provided code creates a class HeapQuiz and performs operations on an array of HeapQuiz objects

    HeapQuiz[] hq = new HeapQuiz[5]; // Array of references to `HeapQuiz` objects

      hq[x] = new HeapQuiz(); // Create a new `HeapQuiz` object and assign it to `hq[x]`
      hq[x].id = x;  // Set the `id` of the object to the current value of `x`

  }
}  

// Important Notes
//Null References: Any object whose references are set to null may become eligible for garbage collection if no other references exist.
//
//No Output Yet: The program does not produce any visible output because the System.out.print(hq[1]); line is commented out.
//
//Purpose: Without more context, this code primarily demonstrates object references and how they are manipulated in arrays.
